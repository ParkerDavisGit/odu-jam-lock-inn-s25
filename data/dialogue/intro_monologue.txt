You know your purpose, Fallen.
The spirits, wronged by the old order...
Seek vengeance. Seek purpose.
They turn to you, with your sullied power to give life.
They know you've been wronged too.
They know you want things to change.
You possess something that does not belong to you.
Not anymore. You can rebuild them.
Aid these spirits in their journey...
To tear the old ways down.
To force those who have grown stagnate...
To realize that things need to change. 
To destroy, in order to build something new.
